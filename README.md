## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Pinecone account (optional - app works with mock data)
- OpenAI API key (optional - app works with mock data)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd swami-raaji-thase
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup** (Optional)

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   # Pinecone Configuration (Optional)
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
   PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment_here
   PINECONE_INDEX=your_pinecone_index_name_here

   # OpenAI Configuration (Optional)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

   # App Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

   **Note**: The app works perfectly without these environment variables - it will use BAPS-specific mock data for demonstration purposes.

4. **Pinecone Index Setup**

   Create a Pinecone index with these settings:

   - **Dimensions**: `1536` (for text-embedding-3-small model)
   - **Metric**: `cosine`
   - **Pod Type**: `p1.x1` (free tier)

5. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🌐 Deployment

### **Recommended: Vercel (Easiest)**
