## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (optional - app works with mock data)
- OpenAI API key (optional - app works with mock data)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd swami-raaji-thase
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
